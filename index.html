      <h5>Totally...According to Ayurveda, ALL good health starts with diet and digestion.</h5>
      <p>Many nutrients in food promote health and protect your body from disease.Eating whole, nutritious foods is
        important because their unique substances work synergistically to create an effect that can’t be
        replicated by taking a supplement.Although your body only needs small amounts of vitamins and minerals, they’re
        vital for your health.

        However, Western diets — high in processed foods and low in whole foods like fresh produce — are typically
        deficient in vitamins and minerals. Such deficiencies can substantially increase your risk of disease.

        For example, insufficient intakes of vitamin C, vitamin D, and folate may harm your heart, cause immune
        dysfunction, and increase your risk of certain cancers, respectively.
        Nutritious foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans, and grains, boast numerous beneficial compounds, such as
        antioxidants.

        Antioxidants protect cells from damage that may otherwise lead to disease.

        In fact, studies demonstrate that people whose diets are rich in polyphenol antioxidants have lower rates of
        depression, diabetes, dementia,
        and heart disease.The protein and fat in whole, nutritious foods play various critical roles in your body.</p>

      <h3>Unhealthy food choices can increase disease risk</h3>
      <br>
      <div class="main-image"><img src='\images\ayurvedic-2.jpg' alt="Healthy" width="570" height="300" /></div>
      <br>

      <p>Unhealthy diets high in sugary drinks, fast food, and refined grains are a main contributor to conditions like
        heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.</p>
      <p>This wisdom is found not just in what we eat, but also how and when we eat, and how we prepare our foods. In
        Ayurveda, our connection to food becomes
        a holistic act that truly looks to food as a gift and respects it as life encapsulated. .</p>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
      <p>Ayurveda is a form of holistic medicine that’s focused on promoting balance between your body and mind.

        According to Ayurveda, five elements make up the universe — vayu (air), jala (water), akash (space), teja
        (fire), and prithvi (earth).

        These elements are believed to form three different doshas, which are defined as types of energy that circulate
        within your body. Each dosha is responsible for specific physiological functions.</p>

        <h5>Seasonal Cleanse Regime</h5>
        <p>Did you know? Allergies, low energy, indigestion, constipation, mood swings, headaches, bad breath, etc. are
          some of the common signs that your Liver needs help.</p>

        <h5>Eat Naturally - As Close to Source as Possible</h5>
        <p>Unlike many other diets, the Ayurvedic diet provides personalized recommendations about which foods to eat
          and avoid based on your body type!</p>

        <h5>Choose Fruits and Vegetables</h5>
        <p>Eat loads of fruits and vegetables, not only for their nutritional value, but also because they are good
          natural internal cleansers. The specific food guidelines found above for Vata, Pitta and Kapha can help us
          pick a variety of fruits and vegetables suited to our physiology and the season. Vegetables do not necessarily
          have to be just separate dishes. Add them to grains, mix them with beans, toss them in stews and soups —
          there's always room for your favorite veggies in every dish. .</p>
